# BudgetApp
USING JAVAEE

For FrontEnd I use html and css.
For backend i use JDBC and JSP.
 
You can run this program by using xampp or local server apache tomcat v9.0. You may face port error. Changing port number will solve the problem.
For database i use MYSql. You need to set up your own sql workbench using sql codes, provided in MYSql file.

Eclipse is used to build the project. So, I recommend you to use eclipse to run or further development of the project.

Happy Coding!
